This plugin allows you to utilize Facebook Connect with Laconica.
Supported Facebook Connect features:

- Authenticate (register/login/logout -- works similar to OpenID)
- Associate an existing Laconica account with a Facebook account
- Disconnect a Facebook account from a Laconica account

Future planned functionality:

- Invite Facebook friends to use your Laconica installation
- Auto-subscribe Facebook friends already using Laconica
- Share Laconica favorite notices to your Facebook stream

To use the plugin you will need to configure a Facebook application
to point to your Laconica installation (see the Installation section
below).

Installation
============

If you don't already have the built-in Facebook application configured,
you'll need to log into Facebook and create/configure a new application.
Please follow the instructions in the section titled, "Setting Up Your
Application and Getting an API Key," on the following page of the
Facebook developer wiki:

    http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Connect/Setting_Up_Your_Site

If you already are using the build-in Laconica Facebook application,
you can modify your existing application's configuration using the
Facebook Developer Application on Facebook.  Use it to edit your
application settings, and under the 'Connect' tab, change the 'Connect
URL' to be the main URL for your Laconica site.  E.g.:

    http://SITE/PATH_TO_LACONICA/

After you application is created and configured, you'll need to add its
API key and secret to your Laconica config.php file:

    $config['facebook']['apikey'] = 'APIKEY';
    $config['facebook']['secret'] = 'SECRET';

Finally, to enable the plugin, add the following stanza to your
config.php:

    require_once(INSTALLDIR.'/plugins/FBConnect/FBConnectPlugin.php');
    $fbc = new FBConnectPlugin();

To try out the plugin, fire up your browser and connect to:

    http://SITE/PATH_TO_LACONICA/main/facebooklogin

or, if you do not have fancy URLs turned on:

    http://SITE/PATH_TO_LACONICA/index.php/main/facebooklogin

You should see a page with a blue button that says: "Connect with
Facebook".

Connect/Disconnect existing account
===================================

If the Facebook Connect plugin is enabled, there will be a new Facebook
Connect Settings tab under each user's Connect menu. Users can connect
and disconnect to their Facebook accounts from it.  Note:  Before a user
can disconnect from Facebook, she must set a normal Laconica password.
Otherwise, she might not be able to login in to her account in the
future.  This is usually only required for users who have used Facebook
Connect to register their Laconica account, and therefore haven't
already set a local password.
