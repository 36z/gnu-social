The LDAP plugin allows for StatusNet to handle authentication, authorization, and user information through LDAP.

Installation
============
Add configuration entries to config.php. These entries are:

The following are documented at http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.networking.net-ldap2.connecting.php
$config['ldap']['binddn']
$config['ldap']['bindpw']
$config['ldap']['basedn']
$config['ldap']['host']

$config['ldap']['nickname_attribute'] Set this to the name of the ldap attribute that holds the username. For example, on Microsoft's Active Directory, this should be set to 'sAMAccountName'

Finally, add "addPlugin('ldap');" to the bottom of your config.php
